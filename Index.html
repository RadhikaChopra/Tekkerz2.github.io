  <h2>Luke Bleeser (S3782106)</h2><br>
  <p>My name is Luke Bleeser and I was born and raised in country Victoria, before moving to Melbourne to begin my Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Honours) in 2019.<br>
  I completed high school in a small country town, and I love to spend time outside exploring the countryside. An interesting fact about me is that I live on a beef cattle farm about 4 hours north east of Melbourne!<br>
  My interest in IT began initially with an interest in all things electrical as a young boy, hence my bachelor revolving around the topic.<br> My interest stems from the ever growing daily need to integrate and utilise IT as it becomes more and more entrenched into our daily lives.<br>
  I do not have a lot of experience in IT and have developed most of my basic programming skills throughout my bachelor’s degree (C, C++, MATLAB).
  I do however wish to increase my knowledge in the area as I find it extremely interesting and relevant to a lot of work done in everyday life.</p><br><br>

  <h2>Radhika Chopra (S3873355) </h2><br>
  <p>Born in Melbourne, I am of Indian descent, and currently work as an ESL teacher in regional Victoria. I got interested in IT during my highschool years playing around with website coding and design in my spare time.<br>
    As of today, I have around 7 months of experience working for a small digital startup in Melbourne where I worked on copywriting and SEO, digital marketing, data analysis, and web development.<br>
    With my learned skills, and as part of TT I hope to bring together my love of the environment and education, to create technological solutions for the future.<br>
    When I am at home, I love playing with my dogs, being creative, and spending time at the beach.</p><br><br>

      <h2>Xavier Occhipinti (S3658061)</h2><br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Xavier, I am 22 years old and live between Melbourne and Warrnambool. I was born in New Zealand and moved all around for my dad’s work, before settling down in Warrnambool where I grew up most of my life.<br>
         My father is Italian, hence the tricky last name, whilst my mother is Australian. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and soccer. <br>
         I also spend my time playing guitar and piano or getting hooked on video games.</p><br><br>

          <p>I am a Bachelor of Biomedicine graduate who recently re-evaluated their career path and found IT the place to be. I am a Kuwait-born, Lebanese individual.<br>
            During my spare time when I am not doing university work, I am usually playing the guitar (been playing for 9 years or so), playing computer games, or messing around with code in python or java.<br>
            I hope to become a proficient programmer in various languages and develop a strong intuition for programming in general. My primary interests are web development, app development and AI development.<br>
            I take most of my inspiration from modern technology & programs.</p><br><br>

<h1>Group Processes</h1>
<p>TeamTekkerz worked reasonably well together for A2, but we identified a few places where we would need necessary improvements to do better on this assignment.<br>
   The first change was more communication, especially through Microsoft Teams. We weren’t really keeping each other informed about where we were at with our designated work, and it was difficult to get in touch when we needed to ask questions of specific individuals.<br>
  As such, we have decided as a collective to be more active on Teams and also try to make it to meetings. We all have busy schedules at the moment, so if someone isn’t able to make it to a meeting, they are expected to check the meeting agenda for to-do items and then check in on Teams.<br>
  Another element we want to change is the distribution of work. Making sure that everyone has a more equal share of the content creation.</p>
<h1>Career Plans</h1>
   <p>All of us have kept to the same career plans we chose in A2. We have all got similar goals, in that majority of the roles require knowledge of coding languages, teamwork and excellent communication skills.<br>
      Most of us have chosen fields where we will be working alongside other IT professionals, and will be required to contribute our share to an overall larger project. <br>
   The roles however do differentiate within the details of the job descriptions. The expected pay is varied, from the lower end of $59,000, to the higher end of $88,000.<br>
    This of course reflects the responsibilities and leadership of the roles, with the higher paid salaries expected to manage a group, or showcase more specialised skill or knowledge.<br>
     Some of us will require more design knowledge than others, and some will be expected to work closely alongside their clients throughout the process.<br>
      Qualifications are also broad, with most of us needing at least a bachelor’s degree at University, plus also a more specialised course relating to our chosen field. <br>
   Overall, although we may have a common starting point, our skill-sets will be quite diverse by the time we reach our goals. </p>
