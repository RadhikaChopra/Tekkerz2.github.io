<h1>Reflections</h1>

<h2>Individual</h1>

  <h2>Luke</h2>
<p>Overall I believe our team worked fairly well on the project. When work needed to be completed it was done so to a high standard and was almost always completed on time. Our group of six conducted three meetings over the entire duration of the project and allowed us to communicate ideas quickly and easily as well as decide what needed to be completed and by whom.<br>
   The document kept with a small agenda and minutes was successful as if people missed meetings they were still able to catch up on work in their own time. This will hopefully follow into A3 with the recordings of the meeting also proving very helpful. Something that could and will need to be improved for A3 will be starting work early.<br>
  As uni students we have a bad habit of leaving things until the last minute and this assignment was no different. If people were to begin earlier we need to stress less when the work gets close to submission time. Something I have learnt about groups is that they don’t always have to be bad! <br>
  Our group communicated well and everyone was very accepting of feedback and willing to rework solutions until the team was happy with them, something which you definitely don’t get in all group projects. </p>

<h2>Radhika</h2>
<p>Team Tekkerz was an interesting group to work with. In terms of content, we were able to assign work to each other and delegate fairly. Most of this work was completed within the specified time frame, and we were good at giving each other feedback and notes on improvement. I think one thing that could be improved would be overall communication.<br>
   It was disheartening at times to message the group and not hear back, especially close to deadline and as the person who had to build out the final product. One thing that surprised me was how easily we could compile information and collaborate over the Internet having never met in real life.<br>
  I think I much prefer face to face communication as I thrive off people’s creativity and energy, but having the documented notes and the meetings was really helpful. What I have learned about groups is that it can be difficult to make sure everyone is on task and able to understand their individual requirement, if you do not have a direct communication pathway.<br>
  Especially working online, you have to put a lot of trust in your team members and their expert skills to get to the end product. Technology can be a great helper, but you have to work around everyone’s schedule and that can make things harder. Compromise and working with people’s strengths is key to success.</p>

<h2>Xavier</h2>
<p>Overall I was happy with the way the group conducted themselves. Communication was sufficient enough to complete the assignment at an appropriate level, however, more communication could’ve been done to ensure all ambiguities were resolved. Meetings on Microsoft teams went smoothly with most people attending a majority of the meetings.<br>
   Work was split amongst each individual in the group. Ideas about the project were agreed upon by each member easily, as we all had similar views on what should occur. One thing that surprised me was how efficient programs such as Microsoft Teams and Google Docs make working in a group over the internet.<br>
  Work and ideas were easily shared amongst members, and feedback about  those ideas were given to each other quickly and effectively. After completing this assignment, I learnt that working in groups always has its difficulties, especially during Covid-19. <br>
  People may have completely different schedules and difficulties to maintain at this time, so working around that aspect in a group is always a challenge. However, as a whole, I believe our group worked very well together and should be proud of each other.</p>

<h2>Suhayb</h2>

<p>The most important thing that our group was able to do was complete the work that was required, and help each other with what needed to be completed. If something was not completed the others would call it out and remind the other person to complete it which is really good. Overall i believe the major issue that we faced was communication, the communication was good but not to an extent.<br>
   We could all benefit from attending the meetings more, I myself need to focus more on improving my communication. One thing that surprised me while working together in a group was how we shared each other's ideas and interests. While working together as a group I have learnt to communicate and finish my required works quickly and efficiently.<br>
  In conclusion I believe we have done a great job working together, while there are places we could improve we still managed to do great even in these rouch covid-19 times where we are stuck in houses and have to communicate online.</p>

<h2>Zen</h2>

<p>Working as a group during this pandemic has shown its challenges, however I feel as though we adapted quite well as far as collaboration. Teams was a bit of a hassle for me personally as my notifications never worked, but in the end, it was quite resourceful and full of functions that made collaboration very easy, especially considering it was purely online.<br>
   Our group communicated and worked well together, arranging meetings and clearly delegating tasks. It was interesting to see other group member’s interest and their take on designing their website. As stated before, communication could have definitely been better as we did have meetings that were missing one or two people at times, but it may have been a limitation of teams with its notification issue.<br>
Overall, if I could rate our collaboration together out of 10 I would give it an 8, whilst we did have a few meetings where people were missing, in the end it was clear what tasks people had to do regardless of them attending a meeting or not. Tasks were delegated clearly, and people volunteered to do certain tasks.<br>
 Everyone had finished what was delegated to them. People were kept up to date with a list of tasks that we needed at the end of our online google doc. This taught me the ways things can be adapted and compromised to achieve a mission, regardless of how inconvenient a situation is. I also liked how the assignments are intertwined and linked together.</p>

<h2>Soe </h2>

<p>Overall, I think our group was easy to communicate our plans and assign works and separate them easily. Even though I was behind for this class and missed the assignment which was a very important piece as a work input that is used for A2, I was able to understand what needed to be done on my part by the help of the advice I got from my members during our meetings.<br>
   It was a little struggle to schedule a meeting as we are not campus but we still successfully got through the messages through MS. It was very easy to communicate and listen to other members' ideas and thoughts, planning was very simple. I believe we worked very well together as a team and managed to finish their own parts.<br>
  I was a bit later on filling my report due to some other assignments I was trying to catch up with and I hope I can finish my works faster in the coming A3. </p>

<h1>Team reflection</h1>
<p>As a group we all agreed that we were able to delegate tasks and use our time efficiently to get the tasks done. We helped each other out, and gave feedback as well as reminders to make sure everything was completed. We continuously iterated our work, as we could all access the notes and add onto what was there. We worked together to produce a well thought out final product. <br>
  Group members were happy to put their hand up to do extra work and when delegated a task it would be completed to a high standard and within a specified time frame. <br>

In terms of meetings, we all tried our level best to attend them, and to contribute as much as we could to the overall project, using google docs to collaborate. The meetings were well spent, as we stuck to the specified time suggestion in the requirements, and stayed on topic. We used MS teams to keep track of our progress, and most of the time it was very useful to get in touch with one another and link notes and documents that were of importance. <br>
The length of meetings was especially positive as we kept them short and sharp to avoid rambling while still managing to include all relevant information. <br>
However, most of us felt that our communication on a whole was a bit lacking. We felt that we began working on the project a bit later than we should have, and then trying to do work closer to the due date was a little stressful. It was difficult at times to get in touch, and to know exactly what each of us should have been working on.<br>
Next time it would be better for us to start early, and to schedule more time to check MS teams, especially as everyone’s schedule is different, we are studying online, and we have the added difficulty of Covid. It is a very hard time for some of us, and so it would benefit the whole group if we attempted to do the work in smaller increments over time, rather than big chucks at the end.<br>
Despite this, overall our group was satisfied with our completed work, and felt that we worked well as a team. We all contributed ideas and content, and tried to meet the specifications as closely as possible. We learnt that although times are difficult due to online learning we were able to complete the task to a high standard when we communicated things efficiently.<br>
For A3 we will make sure to improve on the few problems we had with this assignment and make sure that work is begun as early as possible to avoid last minute stress.</p>
